# Room 315 Kinematic Rail Network

This directory contains the Room 315 kinematic-first shuttle network. The
shuttle is controlled by graph routing and CSV rail geometry, then pushed into
Gazebo with `set_pose`. Contact dynamics, wheel physics, and rail contact are
intentionally not part of this phase.

The repository root `README.md` contains the full operator guide for launching
Gazebo, running one or more shuttles, adding shuttles at runtime, changing
switch states, and controlling the robots.

## Files

- `raw_segments/`: source CSV files for the directed rail segments.
- `normalized_segments/`: preprocessed CSV files with duplicate points removed,
  arc length, tangent, and yaw columns.
- `rail_network.yaml`: explicit graph topology, nodes, segments, switches,
  fixed transitions, start slots, and block placeholders.
- `segment_summary.yaml`: preprocessing summary generated from the raw CSVs.
- `validation_report.yaml`: validation results for lengths, snap distances,
  endpoint gaps, and tangent mismatches.
- `debug_plots/`: generated visual debug plots of the rail network.

## Segment Direction

Every rail segment is one-way only. Motion always follows the CSV order from
`index=0` to the last row in that file. The geometry is used for pose
interpolation only. Routing is decided by `rail_network.yaml`, not by exact
endpoint equality.

If a shuttle reaches the end of a segment and the graph has no valid successor
for the current switch state, the shuttle enters `FALLING` mode instead of
silently correcting or teleporting.

## Regenerate Preprocessed Data

Run these commands from the repository root after editing any file in
`raw_segments/` or after changing the network topology:

```bash
cd /home/tiago/ALI_ros2_ws/src/mfja_3rd_floor_gz

python3 mfja_robot_control_config/scripts/room_315_csv_preprocessor.py
python3 mfja_robot_control_config/scripts/room_315_network_validator.py
python3 mfja_robot_control_config/scripts/room_315_segment_plot.py
```

Expected validation result:

```text
Validated 14 segments and 12 nodes.
Status: PASS (0 warnings)
```

## Build After Changes

Use the meta-repository build command from the workspace root:

```bash
cd /home/tiago/ALI_ros2_ws
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash

colcon build --base-paths \
  src/mfja_3rd_floor_gz/mfja_robot_control_config \
  src/mfja_3rd_floor_gz/mfja_3rd_floor_description \
  src/mfja_3rd_floor_gz/mfja_room_315_bringup \
  src/mfja_3rd_floor_gz/mfja_3rd_floor_bringup \
  src/mfja_3rd_floor_gz/mfja_3rd_floor_gz \
  --packages-select \
  mfja_robot_control_config \
  mfja_3rd_floor_description \
  mfja_room_315_bringup \
  mfja_3rd_floor_bringup \
  mfja_3rd_floor_gz \
  --symlink-install

source install/setup.bash
```

## Quick Runtime Example

Start Room 315 only:

```bash
cd /home/tiago/ALI_ros2_ws
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash

ros2 launch mfja_room_315_bringup room_315_only.launch.py \
  robots:=none \
  start_paused:=false \
  gui:=true
```

Start the kinematic shuttle node:

```bash
cd /home/tiago/ALI_ros2_ws
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash

ros2 run mfja_robot_control_config room_315_kinematic_shuttle_node.py --ros-args \
  -p gazebo_world_name:=room_315_only \
  -p start_slot:=2 \
  -p enable_gazebo_set_pose:=true \
  -p enable_gazebo_spawn:=true \
  -p speed:=0.2 \
  -p gazebo_set_pose_rate_hz:=10.0
```

For full-floor operation, use the same shuttle node and change only the world
name:

```bash
-p gazebo_world_name:=mfja_3rd_floor
```

## Switch Commands

Switch states are controlled through `/room_315/switch_states`. The accepted
states are `LEFT` and `RIGHT`.

Example:

```bash
ros2 topic pub --once /room_315/switch_states std_msgs/msg/String "{data: 'A1=LEFT A2=RIGHT A3=LEFT A4=RIGHT'}"
```

The node also republishes visual switch commands on
`/mfja/conveyor/switch_cmd` so the Gazebo switch visuals rotate with the logical
state.

## Start Slots

The four allowed start slots are defined in `rail_network.yaml`:

```text
slot 1: -14.95 -3.86 0.84 0 0 3.14
slot 2: -15.43 -3.86 0.84 0 0 3.14
slot 3: -15.24 -5.54 0.84 0 0 0
slot 4: -14.77 -5.54 0.84 0 0 0
```

Multiple shuttles can be started with `shuttle_count` and `start_slots`, or
added while the node is running through `/room_315/shuttle/add_cmd`.

## Collision Avoidance

Simple center-distance collision avoidance is enabled by default. The default
distance is `0.33 m`. This is not full block occupancy yet; it only prevents
kinematic shuttles from overlapping by stopping a following shuttle when it gets
too close to another active shuttle.
